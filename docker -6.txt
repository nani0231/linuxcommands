Creating customized docker images
----------------------------------------

Whenever docker container is deleted, 
all the softwares that we have installed within the container will also be deleted.



If we can save the container as an image, then we can preserve the softwares.


This creation of customized docker images can be done in two ways.

1) using docker commit command
2) using docker file




Using docker commit
----------------------

# docker run  --name c11 -it  ubuntu


Update apt repository

# apt-get update
# apt-get install git
 
TO check the git
# git  --version
# exit

TO save the container as image (snapshot )
# docker commit   c11   myubuntu

To see the list of images
# docker images  ( you can see the image which you have created )

++++++++++++++++++++++
Now lets run the image which we have created
# docker run --name c22 -it   myubuntu


# git --version  ( git is pre installed )

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using docker file
--------------------
This is a simple text file, which uses  predefinied keywords for creating customized docker images.

Key words used in docker file  ( case sensitive )

1) FROM  --  used to specify the base image from which the docker file has to be created.

2) MAINTAINER -- This represents name of the organization or the
                 author who created this docker file.

3) CMD   -- This is used to specify the initial command that should be executed when the container starts.

4) ENTRYPOINT - used to specify the default process that should be executed when container starts.
                It can also be used for accepting arguments from the CMD instruction.

5) RUN  -- Used for running linux commands within the container. It is generally helpful for installing the software in the container.

6) USER  --      used to specify the default user who should login into the container.

7) WORKDIR --  Used to specify default working directory in the container..

8) COPY  --  Copying the files from the host machine to the container.

9) ADD  -- Used for copying files  from host to container, it can also be used for downloading files from remote servers.

10) ENV  --  used for specifying the environment variables that should be passed to the container.

EXPOSE -- Used to specify the internal port of the container
VOLUME  --  used to specify the default volume that should be attached to the container.
LABEL  --  used for giving label to the container
STOPSIGNAL  -- Used to specify the key sequences that have to be passed in order to stop the container.

Create a dockerfile by taking nginx as the base image 
and specify the maintainer as logiclabs. Construct an image from the dockerfile.

Creating customized docker images by using docker file.

$ sudo su -
# vim dockerfile

FROM nginx
MAINTAINER abcd

:wq



TO build an image from the dockerfile
# docker build -t  mynginx . 

 ( t    stands for tag, 
    .   stands for current working dir
  mynginx is the new image name    )




TO see the image
# docker images

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


When ever i start my container, i want a program to get executed.

# vim dockerfile

FROM centos
MAINTAINER logiclabs
CMD ["date"]

:wq

TO build an image from the dockerfile
# docker build -t  mycentos  . 

TO see the image
# docker images

Running conainer from the image
# docker run -it   mycentos


++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In one docker file, we can have one CMD instruction.
If we give two  CMD instruction, it executes the latest one
Lets try



# vim dockerfile
FROM centos
MAINTAINER logiclabs
CMD ["date"]
CMD ["ls", "-la"]

:wq

# docker build -t  mycentos . 

# docker run -it   mycentos
( Observation, we get ls -la output )


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In ubuntu container, I want to install git in it.


Lets remove the docker file
# rm dockerfile
#  vim dockerfile

FROM ubuntu
MAINTAINER logiclabs
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y git

:wq


Note:  CMD  -- will run  when container starts.
       RUN  --  will executed when image is created.


# docker build -t  myubuntu . 

Lets see the images list and space consumed by  our  image
# docker images

# docker run -it   myubuntu
# git  --version
# exit
