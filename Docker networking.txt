


#    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
#    sh get-docker.sh

--------------------------------

docker run -d -P nginx


docker ps
( we can see nginx container running )
Take note of container id and inspect the container

docker inspect  d552c14767d4


Note: we can see the IP address
   "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",

Note: Every container will have IP address


Lets take note of docker host IP address - Internal IP -  ( from aws console )
172.31.7.87

Do you think, they both are the same?
NO
How conatiner get IP address?

Note: When we install docker, docker installs a network by default in the host machine called docker0.
Docker0 network comes with default series   -  172.x.x.x
Lets check docker0 network.

# ip a     ( we get all networks in the machine )

Observation: we get docker0 also.
Observe the series -  172.17.0.1
Container IP address are taken from docker0 network.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Lets create another container

#  docker run -d -P redis
# docker ps   ( we can see two containers are running )

Take note of redis container id
a780f294a2c5

#  docker inspect a780f294a2c5


It takes the next ip address from same series

 "IPAddress": "172.17.0.3",

++++++++++++++++++++++++
Now, can these two container communicate with each other?
To check whether containers can communicate with each other or not
Lest create busybox container, as it containes ping utility.

# docker run -d  --name tester1  busybox:1.28 

# docker ps  ( we can see 3 container running )

I want to check, if the containers are connected are not?

Take note of container id of busybox
7216021a4778  -- container id of busybox

a780f294a2c5  -- container id of redis


# docker exec 7216021a4778 ping a780f294a2c5





Is it pinging?  
No

So, with docker0 network  we cannot ping with container ids




Lets try to ping with container name
-------------------------------------------

Take note of container name of redis
hopeful_greider

# docker exec 7216021a4778 ping hopeful_greider



Is it pinging?  
No

So, with docker0 network  we cannot ping with container name

Lets try to ping with IP address
----------------------------------------

Take note of container IP of redis
# docker exec 7216021a4778 ping 172.17.0.2   (  172.17.0.2   -- ip address of nginx )

# docker exec 7216021a4778 ping 172.17.0.3   (  172.17.0.3   -- ip address of redis )

Yes!!! it works.

So, By using docker0 network, one container can communicate to another container by using IP address.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++







Assume, you have two containers
1st one is application container
2nd one is db container

I want to communicate from application container with DB container.
Generally Application container will have the code to connect to DB 
like jdbc:odbc:dbname:dbport/schema/

When both the containers are running on docker0 network.
Instead of dbname , we should mention IP address
like jdbc:odbc:IP:dbport/schema/


Now, Is IP address of container is permanent?
NO
When conainer acquires new IP, we have connection issues.
So,
jdbc:odbc:IP:dbport/schema/  --  is not valid

This is the drawback of docker0







We can use --link option for linking two containers.
--link option is outdated.

At enterprise level  We will create our own network.
using Custom networks, we can ping the containers using container name.

Lets remove all the containers
# docker rm  -f  $(docker ps -aq)

To create a new network

# docker network create sunil


we get network id

01aad5c1a0d886281e8ad1436acf16acdfad175068464655735c3694d98cc5af



To get the network information

# docker inspect  sunil

Observe gateway  series

  "Gateway": "172.18.0.1"


++++++++++++++++

Now, we can create containers in "sunil" network

# docker run -d -P --name app --net sunil  nginx

(  --net is used to assign network to the container )

# docker ps  ( we can see nginx container is running )

To know the IP address of the container
# docker inspect  app

 "IPAddress": "172.18.0.2",

We get custom network IP series

Lets create one more container in Sunil network

# docker run -d -P --name mybox --net sunil busybox

# docker ps ( we can see two containers )

I want to check, if containers can be communicated using name

Lets enter into busybox
# docker exec -it d242f337c68c  sh

#  ip a    ( its a linux command, which will show list of network adapters)
We can see the ip
 inet 172.18.0.3

++++++++++++

Now from busybox, I want to ping nginx container
/ # ping 172.18.0.2

Yes!! It pings

I want to ping with name

/# ping app

Yes!! It pings!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Similary we can also ping with container ID

We avoid links, we used Custom networks  

/#  exit

To see the list of container in a network
#  docker inspect  sunil


Lets create a redis container again
-------------------------------------
# docker run -d -P redis

As we have not mentiond network information, by default it takes docker0 network.

# docker ps ( to see the list of container )

redis belongs to docker0 network
app  belongs to sunil network.

do you think app container will communicate to redis?
They cannot communicate.

# docker ps

Take note of redis container id

19b981c848c6


# docker network connect sunil 19b981c848c6

The above command  is used to connect redis container to sunil network

Now, inspect the redis container

# docker inspect 19b981c848c6


Now, its part of two networks.


Now, redis can be pinged from app container or busybox container

# docker exec -it 4f110bebbfb3  sh

/ # ping 19b981c848c6

It works!!!

/ # exit


To see the list of networks

# docker network ls


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



Types of networks in Docker
------------------------------

Actually, they are not networks. They are network drivers.

Docker follows CNM ( Container Network Model ), By using which container capabilities come to docker by defualt.

There are Following network drivers in-built
-----------------------------------------
1) Bridge
2) Host
3) None
4) Overlay


Last session, we have experienced two types of networks.
1. Docker0
2. sunil ( Custom network )

By default docker0 is of type bridge network.




In bridge networks, container on one machine can communicate to another container, in the same machine.
By default type is bridge.

# docker network ls

We can see "sunil"  network is of type bridge.


Bridge network is confined to one machine only.


Host Network
----------------------
Assume, I am running a database.

I want to use machine IP as the container IP
It is possible by using Host network.

We already have host network available.

# docker network ls

We can see one host network


# docker run -d -P   --net host    nginx


# docker container ps



Observe: There is no port no
Eventhough we have mentioned -P, is has not published port.
We can access directly using IP without port, to connect to the container.

Take the public IP of the Dockerhost and access using default port.

13.233.156.196:80

13.127.218.160:80

We get the nginx page

Ok. fine.

But, can we create the same container again?
No!

# docker run -d -P --net host  nginx



As, 80 port number is already published
When we create another container,It will not be in running.


# docker ps
We can see only one container.

# docker ps -a
We can see the latest container is exited.

To know, Why the container is exited?
Take note of the container id, which is exited


df259a678bc6

# docker logs df259a678bc6



We can see clearly  as " Address already in use"

So, with host network, one type of image we can use only once.


Null Network
----------------
Refers to no network.
If we do  not want the container to get exposed to the world.

# docker run -d -P --net none redis

# docker ps
Take note of container id
75c18ef13fc8

# docker inspect 4e793540f97e

We do not see any IP for the container

"IPAddress": ""

When none network is used?
When we use orchestration tools like Kubernetes or openshift.
If you want orchestration tools to take of networking, in such case we do not want docker networking.
In such case we use none network of docker.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

In realtime, we know, container will be running on multiple machines ( docker swarm ).
When container present in one machine, want to communicate to container in another machine

# docker info

We can see - Swarm in inactive

 Swarm: inactive

I want to initialize swarm

#  docker swarm init

Now, lets see the list of networks

# docker network ls

Observer, a new network is created of type "overlay"
Name of the network is ingress

One machine container can communicate to another machine container using overlay network.

Lets inspect ingress network.

# docker inspect  ingress

Observe the IP address, Lets take a note of it.

 "IPv4Address": "10.0.0.2

Now, when we create container using service concept,
The container uses overlay network.
Docker swarm uses overlay network.

# docker service create --name s1 --replicas 5 -p 1234:80 nginx

As we have one machine right now.
All the container will be running in the same machine ( Manager )

# docker ps

I want to know the IP addres of the 1st container.
Take note of the 1st container ID
0ac84d7cdd37

# docker inspect  0ac84d7cdd37



Observer the IP address is  
"IPAddress": "10.0.0.7"
It has taken overlay network series.

So, swarm uses existing overlay network for communication between containers on different machines.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Can we create our own overlay network?
Yes!!

Lets create

# docker network create ol1 --driver overlay

# docker network ls  ( to see the list of networks )

We can see ol1  network is created of type overlay

# docker inspect ol1  (  To know the series it is taking )

 "Subnet": 10.0.1.0

It has taken 1.0 series

+++++++++++++++++++++++
Lets delete the existing service

# docker service rm  s1

Lets remove all the existing containers

# docker rm -f `docker ps -aq`

Lets create service on ol1 network

# docker service create --name mynginx --replicas 5 --network ol1 -p 1224:80   nginx

# docker ps
Take note of the 1st container id

814d5db02f47


# docker inspect 814d5db02f47




We can see the network as ol1. And the Ip address series.

 "ol1": {
                    "IPAMConfig": {
                        "IPv4Address": "10.0.1.7"

We generally used bridge and overlay networks.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
