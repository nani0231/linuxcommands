Docker
------------

Docker is a containerization tool.

Virtualization -- Fixed hardware allocation.

Containerization - No Fixed Hardware

Process isolation ( Dependency in os is removed )

Docker editions

2 enterprise edition
remaining all are same
90% Of companeys worked docker on linux based machines
docker it has own set of commands these commands will work on any OS...
--------------------------------------------------------
 
Docker containers eliminate the need for a separate guest operating system for every new virtual machine.

Docker implements a high-level API to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation. 

A Docker container enables rapid deployment with minimum run-time requirements. 
It also ensures better management and simplified portability.
 This helps developers and operations team in rapid deployment of an application.

Create Ubuntu Machine on AWS
All Traffic - anywhere

Connect using git bash

https://get.docker.com/


Go to Root Account
$ sudo  su -
# curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh ( this will download shell script in the machine)

# sh get-docker.sh  ( This will execute the shell script, which will install docker )


How to check the docker is installed or not

# docker --version

We should be comformatable with four terms
1) Docker Images   
   Combinations of binaries / libraries which are necessary for one software application.

2) Docker Containers  
   When image is executed comes into running condition, it is called container.

3) Docker Host
   Machine on which docker is installed, is called as Docker host.

4) Docker Client...
   Terminal used to run docker run commands ( Git bash )


On linux machine, git bash will work like docker client.

Docker Commands
--------------------
Working on Images
-------------------------
1 To download a docker image 
   docker pull image_name 

2 To see the list of docker images 
  docker image ls 
  (or) 
  docker images 

3 To delete a docker image from docker host 
  docker rmi image_name/image_id 

4) To upload a docker image into docker hub 
   docker push image_name 

5) To tag an image 
   docker tag   image_name   ipaddress_of_local_registry:5000/image_name 

6) To build an image from a customised container 
  docker   commit  container_name/container_id     new_image_name 

7) To create an image from docker file 
   docker build -t    new_image_name 

8) To search for a docker image 
   docker search image_name 

9)  To delete all images that are not attached to containers 
   docker system prune -a

Working on containers
-----------------------------

10) To see the list of all running continers 
   docker  container  ls 

11) To see the list of running and stopped containers 
    docker   ps -a 

12) To start a container 
    docker  start  container_name/container_id 

13) To stop a running container 
    docker stop   container_name/container_id 

14) To restart a running container 
   docker restart container_name/container_id 
         To restart after 10 seconds 
   docker restart  -t  10  container_name/container_id 

15) To delete a stopped container 
    docker  rm  container_name/container_id

16) To delete a running container 
    docker  rm  -f  container_name/container id 

17) To stop all running containers 
    docker stop $(docker ps -aq) 

18) To restart all containers 
    docker restart $(docker ps -aq) 

19) To remove all stopped containers 
    docker rm $(docker ps -aq) 


20) To remove all contianers(running and stopped) 
    docker rm -f  $(docker ps -aq) 

21) To see the logs generated by a container 
   docker logs container_name/container_id 

22) To see the ports used by a container 
   docker port container_name/container_id 

23) To get detailed info about a container 
   docker inspect container_name/container_id 

24) To go into the shell of a running contianer which is moved into background 
   docker attach container_name/container id 

25) To execute anycommand in a container 
   docker exec -it container_name/container_id command
   Eg: To launch the bash shell in a contianer 
   docker exec -it container_name/container_id    bash 


26) To create a container from a docker image  ( imp )
     docker run image_name

Run command options 

-it 	for opening an interactive terminal in a container 


--name 	Used for giving a name to a container 

-d 	Used for running the container in detached mode as a background process 

-e 	Used for passing environment varaibles to the container 

-p 	Used for port mapping between port of container with the dockerhost port.

 
-P 	Used for automatic port mapping ie, it will map the internal port of the container 
                with some port on host machine. 
               This host port will be some number greater than 30000 

-v 	Used for attaching a volume to the container 

--volume-from 	 Used for sharing volume between containers 

--network 	Used to run the contianer on a specific network 
--link 		Used for linking the container for creating a multi container architecture 

--memory  	Used to specify the maximum amount of ram that the container can use

# docker images   ( There are no images )





To download tomcat image

# docker pull tomee


# docker images		

# docker pull ubuntu

If you do not specify the version, by default, we get latest version

I want to download jenkins
# docker pull jenkins
