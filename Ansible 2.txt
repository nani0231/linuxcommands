2 Ways  ansible can 
1) adhoc commands
2) playbooks

adhoc commands
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important modules in ansible
1) command - This module is used for executing basic linux commands on managed nodes.
2) shell -  This module is used to execute commands which involved redirection and piping and to execute shell scripts on managed nodes.
3) ping  --  This module is used to check if the remote server is pingable or not.
4) user --  This module is used for user management like create user, setting password, assign home directory  etc

5) copy  --  This module is used to copy the files and folders from controller to managed nodes


6) fetch  --  This module is used to copy files and folder from managed nodes to controller

7) file  --  This module is used for creating or deleting files and folders on managed nodes.

8) stat  --  Used to capture detailed information about files and folders present in managed nodes.

9) debug --  Used to display output of any module

10) apt   --  Used for performing package management on managed nodes ie installing softwares / upgrading repositories  etc . It works on ubuntu, debain flavours of linux. 

11) yum  --  similar to apt module. It works on Red hat linux, centos etc


12) git  --  used to perform git version controlling on managed nodes

13) replace -- This is used to replace specific text in configuration file with some other text.


14) service  -- used for starting / stoping / restarting services on managed nodes.

15) include  --  Used for calling child play books  from parent play book

16) uri    -- useful in checking  if remote url is reachable or not.

17) docker_container  --  used to execute docker  commands related to container management on managed nodes

18) docker_image  --  used to execute commands related to docker images on managed nodes.

19) docker_login  --  used to login to docker hub from managed nodes.

20) setup   --  used to capturing system information related to the managed nodes.

$ ansible all -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m command -a 'free'




$ ansible all -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m command -a 'touch file1'






To check the file which is created
$ ssh 172.31.10.243    ( this command will go that machine  )
$  ls  
$  exit    ( to come back to controller )

++++++++++++++++
To install docker in all managed nodes



$ ansible all -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m shell -a 'curl  -fsSL  https://get.docker.com  -o get-docker.sh'   

$ ansible all -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m shell -a 'sh get-docker.sh'   

+++++++++++++





To check docker is installed or not

$ ssh 172.31.10.243
$ docker  --version
$  exit  (  to come back to controller )

Notes:

Ansible performs remote configurations in 2 ways
1) using adhoc commands
2) using play books

Syntx of adhoc commands
$ ansible  all/group_name/ipaddress -i  path_of_inventory_file -m modulename  -a  'arguments'

+++++++++++++++++
Ansible command module to check the  memory info on all managed nodes

$ ansible all -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m command -a 'free'



++++++++++++++++++
To open the default inventory file

$ sudo vim  /etc/ansible/hosts

( Observation:  3 ip address are available )

+++++++++++++++++
Now, I copy the first two IP address (  in a  new notepad file )
quit the inventory file

+++++++++++++

Create my own inventory file
$ vim  myinventory
go to insert mode

paste one ip address
save and quit

+++++++++++
To check the inventory file

$ cat myinventory

+++++++++++
$ ansible all -i myinventory -m command -a 'free'



Observation:  free command works on only one machines

+++++++++++++
If you do not mention the inventory file, it takes default inventory file.
ex:


$ ansible all  -m command -a 'free'

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



command module is the default module in ansible

$ ansible all  -a 'free'

++++++++++++++++++++++







Note:
The defualt inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts  and when using this inventory file, we need not use -i option.
ex:
$ ansible all  -m command -a 'free'

The default module  is module. When using command module we need not use -m option
ex:
$ ansible all  -a 'free'

Shell Module
----------------
ansible command to execute ls  -la  and store the output into  file2 on all the managed nodes.

$ ansible  all  -m  shell -a 'ls -la > file2'

To check the file which is created

$ ssh 172.31.10.243
$ ls
$ exit   ( to come back to controller )

+++++++++++++++
command to install docker  on all managed nodes

$ ansible all  -m shell -a 'curl  -fsSL  https://get.docker.com  -o get-docker.sh'   

$ ansible all -m shell -a 'sh get-docker.sh'   

++++++++++++++++++++++++
User Module:
( From controller )
To create new user

$ sudo  useradd sai
$ vim /etc/passwd     (  User will be created in this file )
To set the password
$ sudo passwd  sai      ( sai is the username)


All users information is present in  passwd file.

$ cd /etc
ls


$ vim  /etc/passwd



+++++++++++
Now, i want to create user in all managed nodes

$ ansible  all -m user  -a  'name=kiran  password=welcome'
( we ger error : permission denied )



$ ansible  all -m user  -a  'name=kiran  password=welcome'  -b  ( become , for higher privileges on managed nodes )






++++++++++++++
To check if user is create or not

$  ssh 172.31.7.62
$ vim  /etc/passwd
$  exit

+++++++++++++++++++++
Command to create user and set home directory, user id,  default working shell etc
Another example

$ ansible all -m user  -a 'name=Ravi password=freefree uid=1234 comment="A regular user"  home=/home/ubuntu/Ravi shell=/bin/bash' -b







To check for the new user
$  ssh 172.31.4.54
$ vim  /etc/passwd

++++++++++

Install git in all managed nodes
--------------------------------
$ ansible all -m apt  -a 'name=git  state=present' -b




Observation: 
We get "changed": false
( That means git is already installed on it. The command has no effect in the nodes)

Now , run the below command

$ ansible all -m apt  -a 'name=git  state=absent' -b
( absent  means - uninstall )

output, we get in yellow color 
( scroll up )  we get  "changed":true
( The command is effected the instance )


Now if we run the below command  ( with present option )
$ ansible all -m apt  -a 'name=git  state=present' -b

we get  "changed":true	

Notes:
apt module  -- This is used for package management.
1)  ansible all -m apt  -a 'name=git  state=present' -b


state=present  is for installation
state=latest    for upgradation
state=absent    for uninstallation

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
I wan to update apt-repositoty and install tomcat9

ansible all -m  apt -a 'name=tomcat9 state=present  update_cache=yes' -b




The above command will install apt repository and install tomcat9
To install apt-repository on managed nodes  update_cache=yes  is used 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

File module
--------------
This is used to create files and folder on managed nodes



  ansible all  -m  file -a  'name=/tmp/file5  state=touch' 



To check the file which is create
$ ssh 172.31.3.106
$ cd  /tmp
$ ls
$ exit

TO create a directory
   ansible all  -m  file -a  'name=/tmp/dir1  state=directory' 

To check the directory
$  ssh 172.31.39.33
$ cd  /tmp
$ ls
$ exit

To delete the  file
ansible all  -m  file -a  'name=/tmp/file5  state=absent' 

++++++++++++++++++++++++
Notes:
Command to create a file on all managed nodes

ansible all  -m  file -a  'name=/tmp/file1  state=touch' 

state=touch   is to create files
state=directory  is to create directory
state=absent  is for deleting file/directory

++++++++++++++++++++
Now,
To know the current user
$ whoami
$  ansible all  -m  file -a  'name=file1  state=touch' 



Now go to managed nodes and check the permission of the file
$ ssh 172.31.3.106
$ ls -l file1

Observe the permissions  are   rw-rw-r--

Now, I want to change the permissions from controller
$ exit   ( will come back to controller )

$  ansible all  -m  file -a  'name=/tmp/file6  state=touch owner=root group=root  mode=700'  -b



The above command will execute  only if Anu user and Ravi  group is available in all nodes.

Notes:
File module can be used to change the ownership, group ownership and permissions on the file.


Copy Module
---------------
This is used for copying the files from controller into managed nodes.

We know in the file  /etc/passwd  we have all the information about users

Now I want to copy the file  into all nodes

$ ansible all -m  copy  -a 'src=/etc/passwd     dest=/tmp'




To check the file which is copies

$ ssh 172.31.3.106
$ cd /tmp
$ ls
$ exit

++++++++++++++
