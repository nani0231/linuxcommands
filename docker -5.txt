Docker volumes
------------------
Docker containers are  ephemeral ( temporary )
Where as the data processed by the container should be permanent.

Generally, when a container is deleted all its data will be lost.
To preserve the data, even after deleting the container, we use volumes.

Volumes are of two types
1) Simple docker volumes
2) Docker volume containers ( Sharable volume )

Simple docker volumes
-----------------------------
These volumes are used only when we want to access the data, 
even after the container is deleted. 
But this data cannot be shared with other containers.



usecase
------------
1) Create a directory called /data ,  
start centos as container and mount /data as volume. (instructs the operating system to attach a file system at a specified directory)
Create files in mounted volume in centos container,
exit from the container and delete the container. Check if the files are still available.




Lets create a folder  with the name  
# mkdir  /data

# docker run --name c1 -it -v /data centos  ( v option is used to attach volume)





# ls  ( Now, we can see the data folder also in the container)

# cd data
# touch file1   file2 
# ls
# exit  ( To come out of the container )
# docker inspect c1

We can see under mounts "data" folder it located in the host machine.
Copy the path
/var/lib/docker/volumes/17ad62b52cf7ca8bc8b3ce217bbfa8ee45b680cce149ec00e030c6cbb952ba9a/_data

/var/lib/docker/volumes/c5c85f87fdc3b46b57bb15f2473786fe7d49250227d1e9dc537bc594db001fc6/_data

Now, lets delete te container
# docker rm -f c1

After deleting the container, lets go to the location of the data folder

# cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/d867766f70722eaf8cba651bc1d64c60e9f49c5b1f1ebb9e781260f777f3c7e8/_data

# ls  ( we can see file1  file2 )

( Observe , the container is deleted but still  the data is persistant )

docker volume containers
-------------------------------
These are also known as reusable volume.
The volume used by one container can be shared with other containers.
Even if all the containers are deleted, data will still be available on the docker host.

Ex:

# sudo su -

Lets create a directory      /data
# mkdir  /data 

Lets Start  centos as container 
#  docker run --name  c1  -it  -v /data ubuntu 
# ls  ( we can see the list of files and dir in centos )


# cd data
# ls  ( currently we have no files )

Lets create  some files
# touch file1  file2  ( These two files are available in c1 container)

Comeout of the container without exit
# Ctrl +p +q  ( container will still runs in background )


Lets Start another  centos as container ( c2 container should use the same volume as c1)
#  docker run --name  c2  -it  --volumes-from c1  ubuntu 



# cd data
# ls  ( we can see the files created by c1 )

Lets create some more files
# touch file3  file4
# ls  ( we see 4 files )

Comeout of the container without exit
# Ctrl +p  Ctrl +q  ( container will still runs in background )

Lets Start another  centos as container
#  docker run --name  c3  -it  --volumes-from c2 centos 



# cd data
# ls  ( we can see 4 files )
# touch file5  file6
# ls

Comeout of the container without exit
# Ctrl +p  Ctrl +q  ( container will still runs in background )

Now, lets connect to any container which is running in the background
# docker attach  c1
#  ls  ( you can see all the files )
# exit

Identify the mount location
$ docker inspect  c1
( search for the mount section )

Take a note of the source path

/var/lib/docker/volumes/e22a9b39372615727b964151b6c8108d6c02b13114a3fcce255df0cee7609e15/_data



Lets remove all the container
# docker rm -f  c1  c2  c3

Lets go to the source path

# cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/e22a9b39372615727b964151b6c8108d6c02b13114a3fcce255df0cee7609e15/_data


# ls  ( we can see all the files )

Creating customized docker images
----------------------------------------

Whenever docker container is deleted, 
all the softwares that we have installed within the container will also be deleted.



If we can save the container as an image, then we can preserve the softwares.


This creation of customized docker images can be done in two ways.

1) using docker commit command
2) using docker file




Using docker commit
----------------------

# docker run  --name c11 -it  ubuntu


Update apt repository

# apt-get update
# apt-get install git
 
TO check the git
# git  --version
# exit

TO save the container as image (snapshot )
# docker commit   c11   myubuntu

To see the list of images
# docker images  ( you can see the image which you have created )

++++++++++++++++++++++
Now lets run the image which we have created
# docker run --name c22 -it   myubuntu


# git --version  ( git is pre installed )
