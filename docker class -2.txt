Run command options 

-it 	for opening an interactive terminal in a container 


--name 	Used for giving a name to a container 

-d 	Used for running the container in detached mode as a background process 

-e 	Used for passing environment varaibles to the container 



-p 	Used for port mapping between port of container with the dockerhost port.

 
-P 	Used for automatic port mapping ie, it will map the internal port of the container 
                with some port on host machine. 
               This host port will be some number greater than 30000 

-v 	Used for attaching a volume to the container 

--volume-from 	 Used for sharing volume between containers 

--network 	Used to run the contianer on a specific network 
--link 		Used for linking the container for creating a multi container architecture 

--memory  	Used to specify the maximum amount of ram that the container can use

# docker images   ( There are no images )





To download tomcat image

# docker pull tomee


# docker images		

# docker pull ubuntu

If you do not specify the version, by default, we get latest version

I want to download jenkins

# docker pull jenkins/jenkins



TO create a container from an image


#  docker run       --name c1      -p        7070:8080              tomee


#  docker run         --name   c1   -p    7070:8080   tomee






TO check the tomcat is running or not
http://35.154.212.55:7070

( 7070 is port number mapped in docker host)

Lets remove the container  ( Open another gitbash terminal)

# docker stop  c1


# docker rm -f c1

# docker run --name   mytomcat  -p 7070:8080     -d      tomee



( The above command  runs tomcat in detached mode , so we get out # prompt back )
 
# docker container ls

TO start jenkins
#  docker run --name myjenkins       -p 9090:8080         -d       jenkins/jenkins




To check for jenkins ( Open browser )
 http://65.2.127.233:9090

To create ubuntu container

#  docker run --name myubuntu  -it    ubuntu





Observation:  You have automatically entered into ubuntu
# ls  ( To see the list of files in ubuntu )
# exit  ( To comeout of container back to host )

Scenario 1:
Start tomcat as a container and name it as "webserver". Perform port mapping and run this container in detached mode

# docker run --name  webserver  -p 7070:8080  -d tomee

To access homepage of the tomcat container
Launch any browser
public_ip_of_dockerhost:7070

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++





Scenario 2:
Start jenkins as a container in detached mode , name is as "devserver", perform port mapping

# docker run -d  --name  devserver  -p 9090:8080 jenkins/jenkins

To access home page of jenkins ( In browser)
public_ip_of_dockerhost:9090

Scenario 3:  Start nginx as a container and name as "appserver", run this in detached mode ,   perform automatic port mapping 

Generally we pull the image and run the image

Instead of pulling, i directly   

# docker run --name  appserver  -P  -d  nginx 



( if image is not available, it perform pull operation automatically )
( Capital P  , will perform automatic port mapping )



How to check nginx is running or not? ( we do not know the port number)

To know the port that is reserved for nginx )
# docker port  appserver
80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32768

80  is nginx port
32768  is  dockerhost port

or

#  docker container ls    ( to see the port of nginz and docker host )

To check nginx on browser
13.126.59.69:49153

To start centos as container

# docker run --name mycentos  -it  centos
#  exit  ( To come back to dockerhost )
